# dungeoneering

dungeoneering is a minimalistic combat grid and dungeon explorer for use in
local tabletop RPG sessions. It can load static and animated maps, has a
dynamic lighting system, offers lots of conditions that can be easily applied
to tokens and more.

The main goal here is to make an application with all the basic features needed
to run a tabletop RPG session. It should be easy to install, setup and run and
should have a minimalistic, intuitive and hopefully pretty user interface.
