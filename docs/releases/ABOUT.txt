# dungeoneering

dungeoneering is a minimalistic virtual tabletop (VTT) that can be used as a
combat grid or as a dungeon exploration tool, made for local, in-person
tabletop RPG sessions. It can load static and animated maps, has a dynamic
lighting system, offers lots of conditions that can be easily applied to
tokens, and more.

The main goal here is to make an application with all the basic features needed
to run a tabletop RPG session. It should be easy to install, set up, and run
and should have a minimalistic, intuitive, and hopefully pretty user interface.
