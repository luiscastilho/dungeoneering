# dungeoneering

dungeoneering is a free and slimmed down virtual tabletop (VTT) that can be
used as a combat grid and as a dungeon exploration tool, made for local,
in-person tabletop RPG sessions. It can load static and animated maps, has a
dynamic lighting system, can be easily used with D&D 5e games, and more.

The main goal here is to make an application with all the basic features needed
to run a tabletop RPG session. It should be easy to install, set up, and run
and should have a minimalistic, intuitive, and hopefully pretty user interface.
