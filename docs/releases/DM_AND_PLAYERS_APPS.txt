# Single and Dual Screen Modes

If you are going to use a single screen, to be shared by DM and players, run
the executable called dungeoneering and you are all set.

If you want to use two separate screens connected to the same computer, one for
the DM and another one to be shared by your players, run dungeoneeringDm first,
and once the application loads run dungeoneeringPlayers. The two applications
should work as a single virtual tabletop, they should connect to each other and
a scene loaded in the DM app should load in the players' app as well. After
that any changes made in the scene should be replicated in both directions - a
token moved by a player should move in the DM app, a condition applied by the
DM should show up in the players' app, same for any other changes made in the
scene.

Remember to disable any network software, such as VPN or proxy, before running
dungeoneering in dual-screen mode. In this mode, dungeoneering uses network
ports to connect the two apps and in my tests, some network software caused
problems and didn't let the two apps connect properly.
