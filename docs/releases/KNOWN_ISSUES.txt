# Known Issues

- Dialog windows may appear behind the full-screen application, forcing users
to switch between open windows to find the dialog that was just opened.

- Video and audio playback can be glitchy depending on the format/codec/
framerate of the video being used. If you are having trouble with some of your
video maps, try re-encoding them to 1080p30. In Windows it's quite easy: use
[HandBrake][1] and in the Preset field choose General > Fast 1080p30. Create an
issue if it doesn't work even after re-encoding.

- Tokens may look pixelated if zoom in is used, even if loading high-resolution
token images.
