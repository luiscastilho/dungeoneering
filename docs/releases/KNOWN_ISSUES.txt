# Known Issues

- Video and audio playback can be glitchy depending on the format/codec/
framerate of the video being used. If you are having trouble with some of your
video maps, try reencoding them to 1080p30. In Windows it's quite easy: use
[HandBrake][1] and in the Preset field choose General > Fast 1080p30. Let me
know in the issues if it doesn't work even after reencoding.

- Tokens may look pixelated if zoom in is used, even if loading high-resolution
token images.
